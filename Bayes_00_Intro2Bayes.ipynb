Having spent much time away from academia in the real world I've seen that the main activity that work requires of you is to figure out new things on your own, so I want my classes to emulate and practice this process. What I've found while being at UofT is that simply providing a lot of content as lecture material and assuming students will immediately review lecture material to a sufficient level of understanding is not effective for many students (despite this being exactly what works for being successful in classes). \n",
